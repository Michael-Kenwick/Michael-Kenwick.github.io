I am an Assistant Professor in the <a style="text-decoration:none; color: #4682B4" href = "https://polisci.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank"> Department of Political Science </a> at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. Currently, I am also the 2023-24 <a style="text-decoration:none; color: #4682B4" href = "https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/lightning-scholars" target="_blank"> Lightning Scholar </a> in Perry World House at The University of Pennsylvania. 

I research international relations with emphases in civil-military relations, territorial politics, and conflict processes. My work develops novel measurement and research design strategies to better understand how states respond to contemporary challenges in international security.

My research has been supported by the <a style="text-decoration:none; color: #4682B4" href = "https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1917573&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank"> National Science Foundation</a>, and has been published in journals such as the <em>American Journal of Political Science, International Organization,</em> and the <em>Journal of Politics</em>. Before coming to Rutgers, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Penn's Perry World House. I received my Ph.D. in political science from The Pennsylvania State University, and a B.A. in political science and history from the University of Illinois.
