I am an Assistant Professor in the <a style="text-decoration:none; color: #4682B4" href = "https://polisci.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank"> Department of Political Science </a> at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.

I research international relations with emphases in civil-military relations, border politics, and alliance politics. My work develops novel measurement and research design strategies to better understand how states respond to contemporary challenges in international security.
